# Lord of the stRings

The Lord of the stRings application was inspired by the greatest fantasy saga ever told. This simple app is built with react-boilerplate along with Redux and redux-saga for state management.

This app allows users to add strings (with an input field on the Form page) to a list that is displayed on the Home page.  On the Home page, users are able to delete strings in any order.
